/**
 * Central error handling module that consolidates error handling functionality
 * for consistent error management across the application's API layer.
 * 
 * Requirement: Error Handling (7.3.5)
 * - Provides standardized error handling components
 * - Ensures consistent error reporting across all API endpoints
 * - Supports field-level validation errors
 * - Includes request tracing and monitoring capabilities
 * 
 * Requirement: API Layer (5.2)
 * - Optimized for <200ms response time in NextJS Edge Functions
 * - Supports error handling for:
 *   - Drill practice endpoints
 *   - Simulation endpoints
 *   - Authentication flows
 *   - Subscription management
 * - Includes request ID tracking for error tracing

// Note: This module serves as the central export point for all error handling
// functionality. The actual implementations are maintained in their respective
// files (APIError.ts and handlers.ts) to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.
